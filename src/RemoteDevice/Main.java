//4) Write a project named "Remote Device". Create a class "RemoteController" which will be
// simulation the real one to control the TV. Create interfaces Device and Volume. The "Device"
// interface should have methods powerOn(), powerOff(), setChannel(int channel), and currentChannel();
// The "Volume" interface should have methods "upVolume(), downVolume() and mute();
//Write an abstract class TVDevice which will be implementing interfaces Volume and Device
// and has the fields String modelName and boolean isOn (Tip: You don't need to implement
// methods from the interface if your class is abstract).
//Write a class "TV" which extends the class TVDevice. Implements all the methods.
//Write a class RemoteController to control your TV.
//Example of the structure in the attachments.

    public static void main(String args[]) {
    RemoteController remoteController = new RemoteController();
    remoteController.powerOn();
